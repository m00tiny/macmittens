# macmittens

MacMittens is a reference to a joke by famed comedian Dave Chappelle. Mr. Chappelle joked that he likes to bring a "ghetto" homeless man he knows only by the name "macmittens" to important business meetings to gauge whether he should be involved in a project.
The goal of this tool is to be a transparent web proxy for my own research.
It should not alter any traffic, simply log the first time it thinks it has detected potential parameters and/or other end points.
It should also log some basic information, for example, the size and one time and one time only, send a malformed request to that parameter/endpoint/what have you and compare some basic information, for example the size.
If it notices a __large__ deviation, it should notify me in a way that's also not intrusive, as I expect it to be "always on" and don't intend to stop what I'm doing to investigate every single notification.
It's simply a half-way decent starting point, if I get bored and want to investigate some potential issues that I may drive by in my day-to-day web use.
It's not meant ot be too entirely accurate and it's not meant to be incredibly thorough.
That said, accuracy and thoroughness will not be ignored, any improvement in this area is welcome, as long as they don't have any drawbacks as well.
I fully intend to look more closely and manually at this items on my own, at a time when I choose to do so.
